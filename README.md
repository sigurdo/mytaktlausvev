# MyTaktlausvev

**MyTaktlausvev** is a fork of [Taktlausveven](https://gitlab.com/taktlause/taklausveven/), which aims to make it super-simple for anyone to make their own orchestra website based on Taktlausveven. All possibly orchestra-specific details are made generic and can be changed in [`config.toml`](config.toml).
